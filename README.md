As it became really hard to improve at chess, I decided to make and enigne that would hopefully beat me.

Update: it just beat a chess.com 1000 rated bot. Link to the game: https://www.chess.com/game/computer/1016249

Another update: almost beat the 1500 bot, but it messed up at the end when it didn't find mate and repeated moves instead. I need to fix this...
